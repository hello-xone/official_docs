## 6. What is the Behavioral Value Incentive (BVI)? How does it work?

The Behavioral Value Incentive (BVI) system is a core feature of Xone Chain, designed to reward users for their contributions and interactions on the network. Here’s how it works:

* Each transaction, transfer, or network activity accumulates “GV points.”
* These GV points accumulate during each Epoch (a fixed period).
* At the end of each Epoch, the accumulated GV points are converted into XOC tokens and fairly distributed to participants based on their network activity.

The more active users are, the more GV points they accumulate, ensuring that every contribution is rewarded.

This system creates a fair and transparent value distribution model and encourages long-term participation and interaction within the Xone public chain ecosystem.

## 7. What is the total supply of XOC tokens?

The total supply of XOC tokens is 10 billion. The token distribution is as follows:

* **BVI Airdrop:** 50% (5 billion tokens) – Distributed based on user contributions in the BVI system.
* **Staking rewards:** 10% (1 billion tokens) – Released based on staking weight and governance.
* **Investor allocation:** 10% (1 billion tokens) – Distributed over two years.
* **Team allocation:** 10% (1 billion tokens) – Distributed quarterly, completed within three years.
* **Early contributor allocation:** 10% (1 billion tokens) – Released all at once upon mainnet launch.
* **Community allocation:** 7% (700 million tokens) – Released through DAO governance and community activities.
* **Airdrop:** 3% (300 million tokens) – Distributed through additional airdrops.

## 8. Is there a vesting period for the tokens?

Yes, the tokens allocated to the team and advisors will follow a vesting schedule:

* Team tokens: Released quarterly over 3 years.
* Investor tokens: 5% released upon mainnet launch, 95% will be released over two years.

## 9. How do I receive XOC tokens after the donation ends?

## 10. What unique features and advantages (USP) does Xone Chain have?

Xone Chain stands out with the following key features:

* **Consensus mechanism:** Xone uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and achieves rapid node synchronization and handshakes through Efficient Proof of Stake (EPoS).
* **Parallel processing:** Achieved through Parallel Communication and Adaptive Messaging (PCAM), supporting concurrent transaction processing to enhance scalability.
* **XoneDB:** A decentralized database optimized for fast and reliable data storage and retrieval within the network.
* **EVM interoperability:** Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling seamless integration with Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts.
* **Modular architecture:** Allows for easy upgrades and integration of new features without interrupting existing operations.
* **Enhanced security protocols:** Xone employs an advanced security framework that combines multi-signature authentication, zero-knowledge proofs, and end-to-end encryption to ensure transaction integrity and confidentiality. The protocol also includes automated threat detection and response mechanisms to mitigate potential security risks in real-time.
* **Gas fee optimization:** During transactions, part of the gas fees will be burned, while the remainder will be redistributed as rewards to users. This mechanism supports the consensus process and enhances the economic model of gas fees.
* **Decentralized governance:** The platform is governed through a community-driven voting system, allowing token holders to participate in important network upgrades and decisions.
* **BVI airdrop system:** A unique reward mechanism that directly converts user behavior into rewards, ensuring that every interaction has value.
