# What is the TXOC Token

**TXOC Token** is a special token issued by Xone Chain for early supporters through its donation campaign. Designed to grant priority benefits and growth potential within the future mainnet ecosystem, the TXOC token serves as a transitional asset that will later be convertible to the Xone Chain mainnet coin, XOC, once the mainnet officially launches.

TXOC will gain additional use cases once the mainnet is live, empowering holders to actively participate in the Xone Chain ecosystem.


## Why Choose TXOC?

TXOC is not only a testament to early supporters’ involvement but also a valuable asset within the future mainnet ecosystem. By holding and converting TXOC, users will enjoy priority access and unique benefits as the Xone mainnet continues to expand and mature. This token symbolizes Xone Chain’s appreciation for early contributors and grants holders an important entry point into the decentralized ecosystem.

## Looking Ahead

With the upcoming launch of Xone Chain’s mainnet and ecosystem expansion, TXOC is poised to become a crucial asset within the Xone environment. Holders will have the opportunity to convert TXOC into XOC on the mainnet and access additional exclusive platform benefits. Xone Chain aims to reward early users through TXOC, fostering the continued growth of the Xone community and building a more valuable Web3 ecosystem.

TXOC marks the beginning of the Xone journey, embodying the trust and commitment of early supporters toward a decentralized future. Xone Chain thanks every donor for their support and invites the global community to join in, witnessing the growth and success of the Xone ecosystem together.
