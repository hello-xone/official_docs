## Who Runs Xone?

Xone is a decentralized blockchain platform not controlled by any single entity. Xone's existence relies on a network of computers running the Xone protocol worldwide, with these computer nodes jointly recording and maintaining the blockchain's security and integrity. Anyone can become a Xone node and help run the network by running Xone software and following protocol rules.

Moreover, Xone's protocol code is open and built and optimized by the global developer community. Anyone can propose improvements, participate in discussions, and decide on upgrade matters. The Xone protocol implementation is also built by multiple independent teams using different programming languages, ensuring platform flexibility and compatibility, further stimulating community collaboration.

## Understanding Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are automated computation programs deployed on the Xone blockchain that automatically execute corresponding operations when users trigger transactions. Smart contracts make Xone's functionality highly flexible, becoming core building blocks for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized organizations (DAOs).

Have you ever encountered situations where service terms were arbitrarily modified or a commonly used feature was deleted? Once smart contracts are deployed to the Xone network, they exist permanently; as long as the Xone network runs, they will be online and available. Even developers cannot delete or modify contract content. Therefore, smart contract execution is public, transparent, and tamper-proof, unaffected by any individual or organization's wishes.

Smart contract application scenarios are extremely rich, including decentralized lending applications, decentralized exchanges, insurance contracts, crowdfunding platforms, social networks, and NFT applications, covering almost all imaginable application types.

## Xone's Cryptocurrency XOC

On the Xone network, many operations require computation tasks to be executed on its built-in computing system—the Xone virtual machine. This computing service isn't free; it's paid for through Xone's native cryptocurrency XOC. Therefore, users need to own at least a small amount of XOC when interacting on the network.

XOC is a pure digital currency that users can quickly and seamlessly transfer to recipients anywhere globally. XOC issuance isn't controlled by any government or company; it's decentralized and completely transparent. XOC is precisely generated and distributed according to the protocol, mainly issued to stake holders who protect network security by staking XOC.

## How to Handle Illegal Activities on Xone?

Like any technology, Xone might sometimes be misused by criminals. However, since all Xone transactions are recorded on the public, transparent, and immutable blockchain, authorities can more easily track and identify illegal activities than in traditional financial systems. Therefore, Xone isn't an ideal choice for criminals hoping to hide their identity. Nevertheless, the Xone network still has multiple layers of security and risk management measures to monitor potential malicious activities.

1. **Transparency and Traceability**: All transactions on Xone are recorded on the blockchain, immutable and publicly transparent. Although user identity information is anonymous, transaction records are permanently queryable. This allows law enforcement agencies to track on-chain behavior with legal authority, assisting in combating illegal activities.
2. **Smart Contract Self-Execution**: Xone uses smart contract technology; once published, contracts cannot be arbitrarily changed or deleted. This means any malicious behavior relying on smart contracts for illegal activities will always be public, transparent, and available for public and auditor inspection.
3. **Community Governance and Compliance Measures**: Xone's decentralized governance structure allows the community to supervise and adjust network rules. Through community consensus, Xone can implement new rules or security measures to reduce the possibility of illegal activities.
4. **Reliance on External Compliance Agencies**: Under legal compliance, Xone supports legitimate third-party compliance agencies collaborating with its ecosystem partners to ensure platform legality.

## How Does It Differ from Others?
