Please be sure to check carefully and only interact with the following verified tokens.

## Our Verification Criteria

All tokens must meet the following requirements:

- **Contract address authenticity:** The contract address of each token has been strictly reviewed by our official to ensure consistency with the on-chain data.

- **Information consistency:** All information such as token name, symbol, total supply, etc. have been verified on the chain without any risk of tampering.

- **Security audit:** All smart contracts have been tested by authoritative third-party security agencies to ensure the safe operation of tokens.

- **Official release channel:** Token information comes from the official channel of the Xone public chain, and forgery or malicious tampering is never allowed.
