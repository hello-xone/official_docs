# List Of Verified Bridge Tokens

In order to ensure the safety of funds when using the [Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain, we have compiled this list of strictly audited tokens. The tokens listed here are considered credible, and other uncertified tokens have potential risks and may lead to phishing or theft. Please be sure to check carefully and only interact with the following verified tokens.

## Our Verification Criteria

All tokens must meet the following requirements:

- **Contract address authenticity:** The contract address of each token has been strictly reviewed by our official to ensure consistency with the on-chain data.

- **Information consistency:** All information such as token name, symbol, total supply, etc. have been verified on the chain without any risk of tampering.

- **Security audit:** All smart contracts have been tested by authoritative third-party security agencies to ensure the safe operation of tokens.

- **Official release channel:** Token information comes from the official channel of the [Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain, and forgery or malicious tampering is never allowed.
