# Block Explorers

[Xone](https://xone.org/)'s design is transparent, ensuring that everything is verifiable. The official [Xone](https://xone.org/) block explorer provides an interface to access this information. If you need such data, you can retrieve it through the provided block explorer, which is available for both the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Mainnet and the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Testnet. Whether for you or your team, the explorers allow you to view real-time data on blocks, transactions, validators, accounts, and other on-chain activitiesâ€”and much more.

## How to Access?
At [Xone](https://xone.org/), we encourage more developers and community members to leverage the capabilities provided by [Xone](https://xone.org/) for secondary development to meet the specific needs of you or your team. To support this, we provide access to a <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/developers/explorers#additional-list">verified list of block explorers</Link>.
