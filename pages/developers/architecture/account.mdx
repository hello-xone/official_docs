# Accounts

Accounts are essential components in the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Chain, built on the same principles as Ethereum's account system. They serve as entities that hold balances, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts.

## 1. Overview of Accounts

In the [Xone](https://xone.org/), accounts are used to:
- Store XOC tokens and other on-chain assets.
- Sign and send transactions.
- Interact with smart contracts and other decentralized applications (DApps).

Accounts in [Xone](https://xone.org/) follow the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) model, ensuring compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

## 2. Account Types

### 2.1 Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

**Controlled By:** A private key held by the account owner.

**Purpose:**
- Initiates transactions such as token transfers or contract calls.
- Does not contain code or logic, serving only as a basic entity for holding funds.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Associated with a public-private key pair.
- Transactions must be signed using the private key.
- Requires gas for transactions initiated.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="EOA Transfer Transaction.json"
{
  "from": "0xSenderAddress",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "value": "1000000000000000000", // 1 XOC in wei
  "gas": 21000,
  "gasPrice": "20000000000"
}
```
### 2.2 Contract Accounts

**Controlled By:** Smart contract logic deployed on the blockchain.
- Executes predefined logic when triggered by a transaction or internal message.
- Used for applications like DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains code and state.
- Cannot independently initiate transactions; it only reacts to external inputs.
- Executes logic defined in its bytecode.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Contract Interaction.json"
{
  "from": "0xUserAddress",
  "to": "0xContractAddress",
  "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000000xRecipientAddress0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
  "gas": 60000
}
```

## 3. Account Address

### 3.1 Address Format

[Xone](https://xone.org/) accounts use the same Ethereum hexadecimal address format:
- 20-byte address represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed with 0x.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.json"
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### 3.2 Address Generation

An account address is derived from the public key using the Keccak-256 hashing algorithm:
1. Generate a public-private key pair.
2. Hash the public key using Keccak-256.
3. Take the last 20 bytes of the hash as the address.

## 4. Account Functionality
### 4.1 Transaction Signing
Transactions initiated by an EOA must be signed with its private key. This ensures:

1. Authenticity: Verifies the transaction is authorized by the account owner.
2. Integrity: Prevents tampering with the transaction data.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Signing a Transaction.json"
Transaction Hash: 0xTransactionHash
Signature: 0xSignature
```

### 4.2 Nonce Management

A nonce is a counter that ensures transactions are processed sequentially and prevents replay attacks.

**How It Works:**
- Each transaction from an account must include a nonce.
- The nonce starts at 0 and increments with each processed transaction.
- If a transaction with an incorrect nonce is submitted, it is rejected.

### 4.3 Multisignature Accounts

Accounts requiring multiple signatures to authorize transactions.
- Used by DAOs or joint ventures to manage shared funds securely.

**Example:** 3-of-5 Multisig: Three of the five key holders must sign for the transaction to be valid.

### 4.4 Contract-Based Account Logic
**Account Abstraction:**

- Smart contracts can be used to enhance account functionality, such as enabling account recovery or implementing dynamic fee structures.

## 5. Account Creation
### 5.1 Creating an EOA
EOAs are created by generating a public-private key pair using wallet software like MetaMask or Ledger.

Steps to Create an EOA:
1. Open a wallet application.
2. Select "Create New Account."
3. Securely back up the private key or seed phrase provided by the wallet.

## 5.2 Deploying a Contract Account
Contract accounts are created by deploying a smart contract to the blockchain.

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="Contract Deployment Using ethers.js"
const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyContract");
const contract = await Contract.deploy();
console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${contract.address}`);
```

## 6. Security Considerations
### 6.1 Private Key Management
- Store private keys in secure environments (e.g., hardware wallets or encrypted files).
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible.

### 6.2 Smart Contract Security
- Audit contract logic to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Implement fail-safes to handle unexpected contract failures.
