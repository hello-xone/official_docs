# Transaction

Overview of how transactions function within the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Blockchain. Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of [Xone](https://xone.org/), facilitating user interactions, state changes, and cross-chain communication.

## 1. What is a Transaction?

A transaction on the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Chain represents a signed message that initiates a specific action on the network. Transactions can trigger state transitions, execute smart contracts, transfer assets, or interact with modules like staking and governance.

Key components of a transaction include:

## 2. Transaction Lifecycle

### 2.1 Creation
A transaction is created by a user or DApp using a Web3-compatible wallet or API. The transaction includes the necessary fields such as the sender, recipient, value, and gas limit.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Sending Tokens.json"
{
  "from": "0xSenderAddress",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "value": "1000000000000000000", // 1 Xone in wei
  "gas": 21000,
  "gasPrice": "20000000000"
}
```

### 2.2 Signing
The sender signs the transaction using their private key. This signature is used to verify that the transaction was authorized by the account owner.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Signing the Transaction.json"
Transaction Hash: 0xTransactionHash
Signature: 0xSignature
```

### 2.3 Broadcasting
The signed transaction is broadcasted to the network through an RPC endpoint or directly from a wallet.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Sending a Transaction.json"
curl -X POST https://Xone.rpc.endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendRawTransaction","params":["0xSignedTransaction"],"id":1}'
```

### 2.4 Propagation
The transaction is shared across the peer-to-peer network using the Gossip Protocol. Nodes validate the transaction and add it to their local mempool.

### 2.5 Inclusion in a Block
Validators include the transaction in a block during the next block proposal phase. The transaction consumes gas based on its computational complexity.

### 2.6 Execution
The transaction is executed by the state machine. If successful, the state of the blockchain is updated.

Example: Executing a Smart Contract

**Sender:** `0xUserAddress`\
**Contract:** `0xContractAddress`\
**Function Call:** `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`

## 3. Transaction Types

### 3.1 Basic Transactions

**Purpose:** Transfer [Xone](https://xone.org/) tokens from one account to another.

- Sender
- Recipient
- Value
- Gas

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.json"
{
  "from": "0xUserAddress",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "value": "1000000000000000000",
  "gas": 21000
}
```

### 3.2 Smart Contract Transactions

**Purpose:** Deploy or interact with smart contracts.

- Sender
- Data (bytecode or function call)
- Gas

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.json"
{
  "from": "0xUserAddress",
  "to": "0xContractAddress",
  "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000000xRecipientAddress0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
  "gas": 60000
}
```

### 3.3 Staking Transactions

**Purpose:** Delegate [Xone](https://xone.org/) tokens to a validator or withdraw rewards.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename=" Delegating tokens.json"
Xone tx staking delegate <validator-address> 1000xoc --from <user-address>
```

## 4. Gas and Fees

### 4.1 Gas Calculation
Gas measures the computational cost of executing a transaction. Each operation in the transaction consumes a predefined amount of gas.

Example: Gas Usage for a Transfer

**Base cost:** `21,000` gas\
**Additional data:** `68` gas per byte.

### 4.2 Gas Price
Gas price is the fee paid per unit of gas. Users can specify higher gas prices to prioritize their transactions.

### 4.3 Fee Calculation
The total transaction fee is calculated as:

```json showLineNumbers copy filename=" Delegating tokens.json"
Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price
```
Example:
**Gas Used:** `21,000`\
**Gas Price:** `20 Gwei`\
**Fee:** `21,000 × 20 Gwei = 0.00042 XOC`

## 5. Transaction Validity

### 5.1 Validation Rules

- The sender's account must have sufficient balance to cover the value and fees.
- The transaction nonce must match the sender's current nonce.
- The gas limit must be sufficient for execution.

### 5.2 Rejection Reasons

**Insufficient Funds:** Sender's balance is too low.\
**Invalid Nonce:** The nonce is not sequential.\
**Gas Limit Exceeded:** The gas provided is insufficient to complete the transaction.

## 6. Advanced Concepts
### 6.1 Transaction Nonces
Nonces ensure transactions from the same sender are executed in order. Each new transaction must increment the nonce by 1.

### 6.2 Replay Protection
Each transaction is uniquely identified by the sender's address, nonce, and signature, preventing replay attacks.

### 6.3 Atomic Transactions
Multiple transactions can be executed atomically within smart contracts, ensuring all or none of the operations are applied.
