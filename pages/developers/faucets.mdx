# Testnet Faucets

Faucets are developers tools that allow you to get free XOC (and other tokens) on test networks like Xone and Xone so that you can send transactions and create smart contracts. Here you'll find a list of active faucets that you can try out. Different faucets use different authentication methods, so you may have to try a few before you find one that works for you. Faucets can occasionally also run out of XOC, so if you're having trouble getting XOC from a faucet, try another one.

  Tokens on test networks like Xone have no value and are only meant for testing.
