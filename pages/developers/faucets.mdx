# Testnet Faucets

Faucets are developers tools that allow you to get free XOC (and other tokens) on test networks like [Xone](https://xone.org/) and [Xone](https://xone.org/) so that you can send transactions and create smart contracts. Here you'll find a list of active faucets that you can try out. Different faucets use different authentication methods, so you may have to try a few before you find one that works for you. Faucets can occasionally also run out of XOC, so if you're having trouble getting XOC from a faucet, try another one.

  Tokens on test networks like [Xone](https://xone.org/) have no value and are only meant for testing.
