# List Of Major Contracts

[Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain has been committed to building an open, transparent and secure blockchain ecosystem. As part of our open protocol, we list the main, verified and open source smart contracts of the project for everyone to review, review, suggest and expand. Whether you are a developer or a user, it is very important to understand the functions and usage of these open source contracts. Here, we have sorted out the important open source contract information on the [Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain to help you better understand [Xone](https://xone.org/).

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  We encourage you to review and use these open source contracts to build your applications or smart contracts. Each contract comes with detailed documentation and instructions to help you better understand the functions and interfaces of the contract. Open source smart contracts all follow the open source agreement. For details, please refer to the open source agreement of the contract. We believe that open source can promote community innovation and make the [Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain more transparent and credible.

## Security and Auditing

In order to protect the safety of users, we have conducted strict security audits on each open source contract to ensure that its code has no loopholes or potential risks. The contract code is available for anyone to check and further verify its security. We encourage developers to participate in community security audits and contribute to the healthy development of the [Xone](https://xone.org/) public chain ecosystem.
