This End-User License Agreement and Terms of Service (“EULA” or “Terms”) is a binding contract between you (individual user or site visitor, whether in your personal capacity or on behalf of an entity, “User,” “You,” “Your”) and the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Foundation (“Foundation,” “We,” “Us”), governing your use of the Foundation’s services (the “Services”), including the website <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">xone.org</Link> and any related, linked, or connected media form, media channel, or mobile website (collectively, the “Site”).

Currently, [Xone](https://xone.org/) Foundation maintains and operates <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">xone.org</Link> and all Services related to [Xone](https://xone.org/) Chain as a **portal for news, information, and updates concerning the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Protocol or Blockchain (“[Xone](https://xone.org/) Network”) and the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem. To avoid doubt, the Foundation does not control the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Network, nor the activities or data on the network, application development and usage by individuals on the network, transaction validation on the [Xone](https://xone.org/) Network, or network usage.** The [Xone](https://xone.org/) Network is maintained and processed by the global Huione network validators as an open-source protocol.

### 8. Scope of User License

Under the terms of the EULA, these services are licensed to you, not sold, provided that you fully and continuously comply with the terms and conditions of the EULA. The Foundation hereby grants you a personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license solely for your own use and access to these services.

If you violate these license restrictions or otherwise exceed the scope of the license granted under the EULA, you may be subject to prosecution, damages, liability for intellectual property infringement, and denial of access to the services.

Without limiting any other terms of this EULA, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to deny access to and use of the services (including blocking certain IP addresses) to any person for any reason or no reason, including, without limitation, for breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this EULA or any applicable law or regulation.

### 10. Explicit Copyright

All other trademarks and registered trademarks...

### 11. Dispute Resolution

Please carefully read the following section as it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the way you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration (as described below). Under this arbitration provision, class or representative actions or arbitrations are not permitted. In addition, arbitration prohibits you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

* **Prohibition of Class Actions.**

**You and the Foundation agree that any dispute arising from or related to this EULA or the services is a personal matter between you and the Foundation, and any such dispute will be resolved only through individual litigation and not as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.**

* **Dispute Arbitration.**

**You and the Foundation waive the right to a jury trial and the right to resolve any dispute arising from or related to this EULA and the services in court, including claims related to privacy and data security (collectively referred to as "Disputes"). Instead, for any dispute between you and the Foundation, you agree to first contact the Foundation and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending an email using the contact information we provide. The notice must**

i. include your name, address, email address, and phone number;

ii. describe the nature and basis of the dispute; and

iii. specify the relief sought.

We will send you a notice in a similar form. If you and the Foundation cannot reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS, or in the limited circumstances described below, to the court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved by a single arbitrator in a confidential and binding arbitration. Arbitration will take place in Zug, Switzerland. You and the Foundation agree that the dispute will be conducted according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The latest version of the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and is incorporated herein by reference. You acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive the opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and any claims that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(a) You and the Foundation agree that these terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be governed to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 USC § 1 et seq.) (hereinafter referred to as the "FAA"). Under the FAA, these terms, and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and grant any remedy that could be granted in court, including the authority to determine the arbitrability of issues. The arbitrator may conduct individual arbitrations but may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of class or representative proceeding or over any claims involving multiple parties.

(b) Arbitration will allow for discovery or exchange of non-privileged information related to the dispute. The arbitrator, the Foundation, and you will keep confidential any arbitration proceedings, awards, and rulings, including any information collected, prepared, or submitted for arbitration purposes or related to the dispute. Unless required by law, the arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to protect confidentiality. **The confidentiality obligation does not apply to the disclosure of information in preparation for or during substantive arbitration hearings, related to court applications for preliminary relief, or related to judicial challenges to the arbitration award or its enforcement, unless otherwise required by law or judicial ruling.**

(c) You and the Foundation agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to $250 if you are a consumer), and the Foundation will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Foundation agree that the courts in Zug, Switzerland, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of arbitration awards.

(d) Any dispute must be brought within one year of the relevant claim arising, or else the dispute will be permanently barred, meaning you and the Foundation will be unable to bring a claim.

(e) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of your acceptance of these terms by sending an opt-out notice to the contact information provided in <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/study/service#24-contact-us">Contact Us</Link>. To be effective, the opt-out notice must contain your full name and address and clearly indicate your intention to opt out of binding arbitration. By choosing to opt out of binding arbitration, you agree to resolve disputes according to the applicable laws and venue specified in this EULA.

(f) If any part of this section is found to be unenforceable or illegal for any reason,

i. the unenforceable or illegal provision will be severed from these terms;

ii. the severance of the unenforceable or illegal provisions will not affect the remainder of this section or the ability of either party to enforce any remaining claims separately under this section; and

iii. if any claim must proceed in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative manner, that claim must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not through arbitration, and both parties agree that the litigation of those claims will be stayed until the results of any individual claims in arbitration are concluded.

Furthermore, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual from seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent that it allows for such relief to be sought through arbitration, and the remainder of this section will remain enforceable.

### 12. Applicable Law and Venue

Any disputes arising from or related to these terms and your use of the service will be governed by the laws of Switzerland and interpreted and enforced in accordance with Swiss law. Any disputes between the parties not subject to arbitration will be resolved in Zug, Switzerland.

### 13. Corrections

**If you are dissatisfied with the services, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the services.** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. The Foundation may link to products and services provided by third parties through the services. These third-party products and services are not provided by the Foundation, and the Foundation is not responsible for any damages or losses you incur from using or purchasing these products and services. You hereby waive the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar laws in any jurisdiction, which provide: “**A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.**” Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

### 15. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Foundation from any third-party losses, damages, liabilities, claims, or demands (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or related to:

* Your use of the services;
* Your violation of this EULA;

* Your infringement of third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights;
* Any obvious harmful acts you take against any other user you contact through the services; or

Notwithstanding the above, we reserve the right to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, at your expense, and you agree to cooperate with us in our defense of such claims. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you upon becoming aware of any such claims, lawsuits, or proceedings subject to this indemnification.
