# Submit DApp

Anyone is free to recommend new DApps to Xone, as long as it‚Äôs appropriate to do so. Once your submitted DApp is approved, it will be showcased on our ecosystem page on the official website.

**Please make sure to submit the right information in the right place.**

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  It‚Äôs important to note that the DApps we showcase do not imply our involvement in their operations or any affiliation with their products. Therefore, you should stay cautious and vigilant while accessing them to avoid falling victim to malicious actors.
  If you come across any misconduct or behavior that could harm you or your assets while using the DApps we present, please feel free to report it to us and take timely security measures. We strongly encourage such actions‚Äîas long as they‚Äôre the right ones! üï∂Ô∏è

## Important Information

While we warmly welcome new members to join, the selection of DApps showcased on Xone is guided by our goal of crafting an exceptional user experience. Each DApp must align with our core design principles:

- **Inspiring:** Content on Xone should offer users something new and exciting.  
- **A Good Story:** Listed content should evoke a sense of ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù and curiosity.  
- **Trustworthy:** Everything must represent legitimate businesses or projects to minimize user risks.  
- **Targeted:** Products should address one or multiple user needs effectively.  

**In short, Xone aims to provide new users with a ‚Äúseamless onboarding experience.‚Äù**  

Therefore, DApps are selected based on the following criteria:  

- Ease of use  
- Interoperability with other products  
- Security  
- Longevity  
- User experience focus  

Below, you‚Äôll find a more detailed version of our decision-making framework. We welcome your feedback or suggestions for improvement!

## What You Need to Know  

### Inclusion Criteria: Must-Haves

- **Security-Tested Products:** Whether through audits, internal security teams, or other methods, your product‚Äôs security must be reliably tested. This minimizes risks for users and shows us that you prioritize security.  

- **Live for Over 6 Months:** This serves as another indicator of safety. Six months is an ideal timeframe to identify and resolve major bugs and vulnerabilities.  

- **Active Team Behind the Project:** This ensures quality and that users will receive support for their queries.  

- **Honest and Accurate Listing Information:** We expect all submitted projects to provide truthful and accurate information. Products with misleading claims (e.g., stating they are ‚Äúopen source‚Äù when they are not) will be removed.  

### Ranking Criteria: Nice-to-Haves 

Your DApp might not be as prominently listed on Xone compared to others if it doesn‚Äôt meet the following conditions:  

- **Accessible via Most Wallets:** DApps should be compatible with the majority of wallets listed on Xone.  

- **User Self-Sufficiency:** Individual users should be able to engage with your DApp and achieve tangible outcomes.  

- **Onboarding:** Your product should feature a well-designed onboarding process to help and educate users, or provide resources like guides or videos to demonstrate usage.  

- **Non-Custodial:** Users should remain in control of their funds. If your product ceases to exist, users must still have access to and control over their assets.  

- **Globally Accessible:** Your product should have no geographic restrictions or KYC requirements that block certain users from accessing your services.  

- **Open Source:** Your code should be accessible, and you should welcome contributions (PRs) from the broader community.  

- **Community:** You should have a dedicated community space, such as a Discord server, where users can interact with your team for support or to suggest new features.  

## Practical Standards

The more criteria your product meets, the greater the likelihood of being featured on Xone.

If a new product is recommended and meets the must-have conditions along with several nice-to-haves, existing listed products that only meet the must-have conditions may be removed.

Other factors influencing this decision include:  

1. **Does adding (rather than replacing) disrupt the user experience (UX) of the page?**  
   Our website primarily serves an educational purpose, aimed at explaining Ethereum and related concepts. Adding too many options could reduce readability and, in turn, usability for users.  

2. **Does the page risk overwhelming users with too many choices?**  
   Similar to endlessly browsing Netflix without deciding what to watch, overwhelming new users with too many options is a concern.  

These are design decisions handled by the Xone team.  

## Sorting  

Unless otherwise specified (e.g., alphabetical order), products will be listed by the date they were added, from the earliest to the latest. In other words, the newest product will appear at the bottom of the list.

Information on Xone is provided for general reference purposes only.  

## Maintenance

Given the dynamic nature of Xone, where teams, products, and innovations are constantly evolving, we routinely review our content to:  

- Ensure all listed DApps continue to meet our standards.  
- Verify that no recommended product outperforms the currently listed ones in adhering to our standards.  

You can help us with this by reviewing and reporting issues. Feel free to email us at <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="mailto:support@xone.org">support</Link>.
