# Cookie Policy

This Cookie Policy is part of <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">Xone</Link> broader Privacy Policy. It explains how <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">Xone</Link> ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website or use our services. It is designed to comply with the legal requirements of the European Union (EU), the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the United States (US), especially concerning user consent, transparency, and data rights.

## 1. Legal Basis and Jurisdictional Compliance

We adhere to the following regulations depending on your location:

* **EU (GDPR + ePrivacy Directive):** Requires informed, explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies. Users must be given granular choices and the ability to withdraw consent at any time.
* **China (PIPL):** Personal information, including identifiable cookies, must be processed with lawful basis. Users must be informed, and for cross-border data transfer or sensitive data, separate consent is required.
* **US (e.g., CCPA/CPRA):** Requires transparency, the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, and the ability to access/delete certain data. For advertising or third-party cookies, user opt-out must be provided.

## 2. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help recognize your browser or device and perform a variety of functions:

* Ensuring technical operation of the site
* Remembering user preferences
* Conducting analytics
* Enabling advertising and marketing

We also use similar technologies such as web beacons, tracking pixels, and local storage.

## 4. Consent Management

When you first visit our website, you will see a **cookie banner** requesting your consent. This banner will:

* Provide the option to accept or refuse non-essential cookies
* Offer granular control over cookie categories
* Allow access to a Cookie Settings Panel

Per GDPR, all non-essential cookies will be disabled until you provide explicit, informed consent. Pre-checked boxes or implied consent (e.g., continued browsing) are not used.

For users located in China, while local law does not currently mandate banners, we voluntarily offer a similar interface to ensure transparency and informed consent for analytical or advertising cookies.

In the US, particularly for California residents, we provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link where applicable, and allow opt-out of third-party cookies.

You may **withdraw or modify your consent at any time** via our Cookie Settings panel.

## 5. User Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you have the following rights:

* **Access:** Request information about the cookies and associated data stored
* **Delete:** Request deletion of cookies or personal data associated
* **Restrict or Object:** Prevent use of cookies for specific purposes
* **Withdraw Consent:** At any time, without affecting the lawfulness of prior use
* **Lodge Complaint:** With a supervisory authority (EU), regulator (China), or state AG (US)

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us via the contact information in our <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/study/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>.

## 6. Cross-Border Data Transfers

Some of the services we use (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Ads) may transfer data to servers outside your jurisdiction, such as the United States. We ensure that any such transfers are made:

* In accordance with GDPR’s Standard Contractual Clauses (for EU users)
* With separate, informed consent and risk disclosure (for Chinese users under PIPL)
* In alignment with applicable state and federal law (for US users)

We implement security safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and data minimization practices.

## 7. Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the law, our cookie usage, or service providers. We will notify users of any material changes and update the effective date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
