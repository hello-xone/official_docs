# Become a hunter and claim a generous bounty!

As a modular Layer-1 blockchain, **Xone Chain** combines scalability and security, offering a flexible and efficient environment for decentralized applications (DApps). With **EVM compatibility**, we provide developers with the powerful tools and flexibility of Ethereum, ensuring seamless execution and an optimal user experience.

## 🔒 Security is a top priority for Xone Chain.

To safeguard our ecosystem and protect users’ assets, we’re launching a comprehensive bug bounty program with rewards of up to **$1,000,000**. 💰 This initiative invites experienced security researchers to contribute to the safety of the Xone Chain ecosystem.

## ✨ Bounty Highlights

🔹 **Mainnet Assets:**

- Rewards are calculated as **10% of directly impacted funds**, capped at **$1,000,000**.
- A minimum reward of **$25,000** ensures that critical vulnerability reports are not withheld.

🔹 **Bug Severity:**

Rewards are based on the **Xone Bug Severity Classification System V2.3**, determined by the impact of the reported vulnerability.

## 💡 Reward Calculation Details

For critical smart contract vulnerabilities: The reward is **10% of directly impacted funds**, up to a maximum payout of **$1,000,000**. Impacted funds are calculated based on the **submission time and date** of the vulnerability report.

  To encourage timely reporting of critical bugs, a **minimum of $25,000** is guaranteed.
</Callout>

## ⚠️ Exploitation and Repeatability Rules

If the vulnerable smart contract is upgradable or pausable, only the **first instance of exploitative activity** will be considered for a reward. This ensures researchers cannot repeatedly exploit vulnerabilities without reporting them.

- For upgradable or pausable contracts, the reward amount will be based on the **severity of the vulnerability** and the amount of at-risk funds.
- For non-upgradable or non-pausable contracts, if severe repeatable exploits exist, the cumulative impact will be considered when awarding bounties. In such cases, the researcher is guaranteed **10% of affected funds**, up to the critical maximum reward.

## 🌟 High-Risk Vulnerabilities: Advanced Rewards

- For high-risk issues, such as theft, permanent freezing of unclaimed funds, or unauthorized royalties: rewards range from **$5,000 to $25,000**, depending on the scale of affected funds, with an upper cap.
- For temporary fund freezing, rewards will double for every 24 hours of freezing, up to the maximum cap. This ensures longer freezes — potentially causing greater damage or reputational harm — are adequately incentivized.

## 💰 Payment Terms

- Payments will be handled directly by the **Xone Chain team** and denominated in **USD**.
- However, rewards will be paid in **USDH** on the Xone Chain network.

The Xone Chain Bug Bounty Program aims to foster collaboration with the global security community to strengthen our ecosystem’s safety.

**We look forward to working together to ensure the security and success of Xone Chain.**
