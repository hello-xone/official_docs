## 6. What is the Behavioral Value Incentive (BVI)? How does it work?

The Behavioral Value Incentive (BVI) system is a core feature of Xone Chain, designed to reward users for their contributions and interactions on the network. Here’s how it works:

* Each transaction, transfer, or network activity accumulates “GV points.”
* These GV points accumulate during each Epoch (a fixed period).
* At the end of each Epoch, the accumulated GV points are converted into XOC Coin and fairly distributed to participants based on their network activity.

The more active users are, the more GV points they accumulate, ensuring that every contribution is rewarded.

This system creates a fair and transparent value distribution model and encourages long-term participation and interaction within the Xone public chain ecosystem.

## 7. What is the total supply of XOC Coin?

## 10. What unique features and advantages (USP) does Xone Chain have?

Xone Chain stands out with the following key features:

* **Consensus mechanism:** Xone uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and achieves rapid node synchronization and handshakes through Efficient Proof of Stake (EPoS).
* **Parallel processing:** Achieved through Parallel Communication and Adaptive Messaging (PCAM), supporting concurrent transaction processing to enhance scalability.
* **XoneDB:** A decentralized database optimized for fast and reliable data storage and retrieval within the network.

## 18. What is the purpose of collecting my name and Telegram information?

We collect your name and Telegram information to ensure effective communication with you so that we can help you when necessary. Through Telegram, we can quickly answer your questions, process your feedback, and notify you in time when there are project updates or activities. This information is only used for internal communication and will not be disclosed to third parties to ensure your privacy.

## 19. What should I do if I am prompted that my payment exceeds the payment limit?

If you find that the payment limit is exceeded when using a decentralized wallet to pay, this is because the project party has set the maximum transaction amount to ensure that it is processed to prevent on-chain transaction congestion. The purpose is to increase the estimated handling fee so that it can be processed before the transaction, and you don’t need to worry about the actual deduction from your wallet, because only the amount of receivables will be traded when interacting with the contract. If the transaction cannot be made, please try:

**Refresh MetaMask:** Close and reopen MetaMask, and then re-initiate the payment request.\
**Check network settings:** Make sure you are connected to the BSC network (BNB Smart Chain) and confirm the on-chain status.\
**Adjust the payment amount:** Try to manually enter the correct payment amount and confirm whether it is displayed correctly.
