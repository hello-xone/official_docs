# Xone Chain

![banner](public/images/Thumb.png)

## Overview

**Xone Chain** is a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain platform based on the Ethereum protocol and is also the leading **Behavioral Value Incentive blockchain (BVI)**. On Xone Chain, every interaction creates value, and every contribution is rewarded. Through its unique **BVI system**, users' behaviors and contributions are accumulated in real-time and converted into rewards. Xone Chain provides high-performance blockchain solutions with features such as fast transaction speed, low cost, strong privacy protection, and decentralized governance, making it a vibrant, innovative, and thriving ecosystem.

## The Xone Vision

Unlike traditional blockchains that primarily serve as transactional infrastructure, Xone is founded on the principle of value creation through community-driven collaboration. It offers a unique approach to blockchain design, focusing on:

Choosing Xone is not just about its comprehensive functionality but because it brings a new digital experience. From financial independence to privacy protection, from decentralized governance to innovative ecology, Xone provides users with a sustainable, incentive-rich, and continuously evolving future choice.

## Who Runs Xone?

Xone is a decentralized blockchain platform not controlled by any single entity. Xone's existence relies on a network of computers running the Xone protocol worldwide, with these computer nodes jointly recording and maintaining the blockchain's security and integrity. Anyone can become a Xone node and help run the network by running Xone software and following protocol rules.

Moreover, Xone's protocol code is open and built and optimized by the global developer community. Anyone can propose improvements, participate in discussions, and decide on upgrade matters. The Xone protocol implementation is also Developed by multiple independent teams using different programming languages, ensuring platform flexibility and compatibility, further stimulating community collaboration.

## Understanding Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are automated computation programs deployed on the Xone blockchain that automatically execute corresponding operations when users trigger transactions. Smart contracts make Xone's functionality highly flexible, becoming core building blocks for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized organizations (DAOs).

Have you ever encountered situations where service terms were arbitrarily modified or a commonly used feature was deleted? Once smart contracts are deployed to the Xone network, they exist permanently; as long as the Xone network runs, they will be online and available. Even developers cannot delete or modify contract content. Therefore, smart contract execution is public, transparent, and tamper-proof, unaffected by any individual or organization's wishes.

Smart contract application scenarios are extremely rich, including decentralized lending applications, decentralized exchanges, insurance contracts, crowdfunding platforms, social networks, and NFT applications, covering almost all imaginable application types.

## Xone's Cryptocurrency XOC

On the Xone network, many operations require computation tasks to be executed on its built-in computing system—the Xone virtual machine. This computing service isn't free; it's paid for through Xone's native cryptocurrency XOC. Therefore, users need to own at least a small amount of XOC when interacting on the network.

XOC is a pure digital currency that users can quickly and seamlessly transfer to recipients anywhere globally. XOC issuance isn't controlled by any government or company; it's decentralized and completely transparent. XOC is precisely generated and distributed according to the protocol, mainly issued to stake holders who protect network security by staking XOC.

## How to Handle Illegal Activities on Xone?

Like any technology, Xone might sometimes be misused by criminals. However, since all Xone transactions are recorded on the public, transparent, and immutable blockchain, authorities can more easily track and identify illegal activities than in traditional financial systems. Therefore, Xone isn't an ideal choice for criminals hoping to hide their identity. Nevertheless, the Xone network still has multiple layers of security and risk management measures to monitor potential malicious activities.

## A Modular Approach

Xone's modular architecture enables seamless scalability, flexibility, and interoperability. Drawing inspiration from existing Layer 2 rollup technologies and modular frameworks like OP Stack and ZKSync's ZKStack, Xone takes these principles to a new level by embedding them directly into a Layer 1 design.

Key elements of Xone's modular infrastructure include:

- **Customizable Incentive Layers:** Tailored reward mechanisms that adapt to community needs and use cases.

- **Decentralized Node Mechanisms:** A robust node system that encourages sustained participation, ensuring the network's security and decentralization.

- **Interoperability Standards:** Native support for cross-chain communication to bridge assets, data, and users across different ecosystems seamlessly.

## Addressing Gaps in Existing Blockchains

**Layer 1 Limitations:** Many current Layer 1 chains focus on transaction throughput and scalability but lack strong community-driven incentive systems. They prioritize efficiency but often fail to align economic rewards with user participation.

**Layer 2 Challenges:** Rollup solutions like Optimistic Rollups or zk-Rollups offer scalability but rely heavily on centralized sequencers or external infrastructure, leading to risks like vendor lock-in, opaque governance, and limited flexibility for dApps.

**The Xone Solution:** By integrating incentive mechanisms directly into the Layer 1 protocol, Xone eliminates these trade-offs. The result is a blockchain that is efficient, community-oriented, and sustainable, designed to align user actions with long-term ecosystem growth.

## How Does It Differ from Others?

Xone Chain combines Ethereum's technical maturity with Bitcoin's value storage concept while introducing innovative behavioral value incentive mechanisms, forming unique competitive advantages. Compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, Xone Chain has significant characteristics in the following aspects:
