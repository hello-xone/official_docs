# Nodes Overview

Xone Chain is a modular Layer 1 blockchain that enables users to participate through various node types, providing decentralized consensus and data availability support. Through a multi-layered node structure and the USDH stablecoin feedback loop, Xone Chain allows participants to contribute liquidity and staking for network growth, receive rewards, and drive ecosystem sustainability. Here’s a detailed look at the different types of nodes on Xone Chain and their roles within the network.

## Xone Node

Xone Chain supports several node types, each serving a unique function to help secure consensus and ensure data availability across the network:

1. **Consensus Nodes**

* **Validator Nodes:** These nodes participate in consensus by producing and verifying blocks, ensuring network security. By staking USDH, node operators unlock node identities, engage in the consensus mechanism, and earn annual percentage yield (APY) rewards based on GV (Growth Value), calculated according to the chain’s epoch block production cycle.
* **Consensus Nodes:** These nodes synchronize Xone Chain’s on-chain historical data, maintaining network stability and reliability.

2. **Data Availability Nodes**

* **Bridge Nodes:** These nodes bridge blocks between the data availability network and the consensus network, enabling cross-chain operations.
* **Light Nodes:** Light nodes perform data availability sampling on the data availability network, ensuring data completeness and network security while reducing hardware requirements for node operation.
* **Full Storage Nodes:** Full storage nodes store all on-chain data without participating in consensus. They provide comprehensive chain history data for applications that require it.

3. **Xone-Specific Nodes**

* **Project Nodes:** Targeted toward developers, integrators, and ecosystem partners, project nodes participate in chain consensus and verification, earning XOC token rewards.
* **Organization Nodes:** Geared toward enterprises and larger community groups with more substantial storage and computation resources, organization nodes reinforce consensus security and promote Xone’s long-term development.
* **Individual Nodes:** Accessible to community members and individual users with lower hardware requirements, individual nodes become part of the Xone ecosystem with a proof-of-stake (POS) yield benefit.

## USDH Feedback Loop Mechanism

Xone Chain introduces the USDH stablecoin feedback loop mechanism to incentivize node operations and ecosystem participation:

- **Liquidity Provider Rewards:**
Users providing USDH/USDC liquidity pairs on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) earn XOC token rewards, fostering liquidity within the Xone ecosystem.

- **USDH Minting:**
Users bridge stablecoins like USDC or USDT from other chains and mint USDH on Xone Chain. USDH can circulate within the Xone ecosystem, supporting staking and liquidity operations.

- **Node Staking:**
Users can stake USDH to unlock node identities and receive APY rewards. Staked USDH translates to GV values, which determine reward distribution across epochs, ensuring fair incentives.

## XOC Tokenomics and GV Reward Mechanism

The Xone Chain native token XOC supports ecosystem governance and consensus incentives. The tokenomics, coupled with the GV reward mechanism, ensure long-term incentivization for node operations and sustainable ecosystem growth.

- **Total Supply:**
XOC has a capped total supply, distributed through network rewards, node staking, and liquidity provision.

- **GV Reward Distribution:**
Each epoch cycle allocates rewards based on user staking, node activity, and contribution value (GV), ensuring fairness and transparency in node operation rewards.

- **POS Returns:**
Staking USDH as a consensus node provides APY, encouraging users to actively participate in network consensus and enhance ecosystem security.

## Data Availability Network and Xone Light Node Architecture

Xone Chain incorporates a light node architecture that ensures low-barrier access to the network, enabling data availability sampling and high client compatibility. By leveraging light nodes, users can maintain data integrity and availability on-chain without requiring complete data storage.

Xone Chain integrates the USDH feedback loop, node staking, and liquidity incentives into its multi-layered participation model. Users can select node types suited to their needs, participate in the consensus and data availability networks, and earn POS-based rewards. This approach provides an accessible yet robust ecosystem that leverages XOC token distribution and the GV reward mechanism to build a secure and engaged community.
