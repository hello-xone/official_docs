* **US (e.g., CCPA/CPRA):** Requires transparency, the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, and the ability to access/delete certain data. For advertising or third-party cookies, user opt-out must be provided.

## 4. Consent Management

When you first visit our website, you will see a **cookie banner** requesting your consent. This banner will:

* Provide the option to accept or refuse non-essential cookies
* Offer granular control over cookie categories
* Allow access to a Cookie Settings Panel

Per GDPR, all non-essential cookies will be disabled until you provide explicit, informed consent. Pre-checked boxes or implied consent (e.g., continued browsing) are not used.

For users located in China, while local law does not currently mandate banners, we voluntarily offer a similar interface to ensure transparency and informed consent for analytical or advertising cookies.

In the US, particularly for California residents, we provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link where applicable, and allow opt-out of third-party cookies.

You may **withdraw or modify your consent at any time** via our Cookie Settings panel.

## 5. User Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you have the following rights:

* **Access:** Request information about the cookies and associated data stored
* **Delete:** Request deletion of cookies or personal data associated
* **Restrict or Object:** Prevent use of cookies for specific purposes
* **Withdraw Consent:** At any time, without affecting the lawfulness of prior use
* **Lodge Complaint:** With a supervisory authority (EU), regulator (China), or state AG (US)

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us via the contact information in our <DynamicLangLink className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon basePath='/study' subPath='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</DynamicLangLink>.

## 6. Cross-Border Data Transfers

Some of the services we use (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Ads) may transfer data to servers outside your jurisdiction, such as the United States. We ensure that any such transfers are made:

* In accordance with GDPR’s Standard Contractual Clauses (for EU users)
* With separate, informed consent and risk disclosure (for Chinese users under PIPL)
* In alignment with applicable state and federal law (for US users)

We implement security safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and data minimization practices.

## 7. Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the law, our cookie usage, or service providers. We will notify users of any material changes and update the effective date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
