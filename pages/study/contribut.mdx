# Contribute To US

Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! We truly believe that with your support, Xone's future will be even brighter. ‚ù§Ô∏è  

The Xone documentation is open-source and hosted in the `huione-labs/docs` repository on GitHub. The content edited in this repository is presented on the official Xone website at <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.plus">docs.xone.plus</Link>. This guide outlines the contribution workflow, including opening issues, creating pull requests (PRs), reviewing, and merging PRs. Please note that contributions, pull requests, and issues should currently be written in English. In the future, we plan to launch a dedicated project to add multilingual support for technical documentation. If you're interested in helping with this initiative, feel free to reach out via the <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="contribut#support-channels">support channels</Link> mentioned in this document.  

When you submit a PR for review, the Xone documentation team will merge it if approved, request changes, or comment and close the PR. We also have a dedicated team focused on documentation review, and we welcome you to join once permissions are opened if you‚Äôre interested. There are two main ways to open a pull request for documentation:  

- Fork the `docs` repository and work locally, or  
- For smaller updates, click the **Edit this page** link on the right side of any documentation page to edit directly in GitHub.

## Submitting a Pull Request  

### **Important Prerequisites**  

To prevent build issues, you should build the content locally before submitting a pull request:  
- Stop or terminate any running terminal servers, then run `pnpm dev`.  
- Use the terminal's output to fix any issues (e.g., broken links).  
- Run `pnpm fix` to automatically resolve most linting issues (e.g., formatting or style).  
- Run `pnpm dev` again and repeat until no issues are reported ("Client" and "Server compiled successfully").  

Most pull requests should target the `main` branch. Occasionally, the Xone documentation team might request targeting a different branch.  

**Submit Your Contribution for Review:**  

1. Create a new <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/huione-labs/docs/issues/new/choose">pull request on GitHub</Link>.  
2. Select a PR type from the list or choose **Open a blank issue** at the bottom of the page.  
3. Complete the form as required. For blank PRs, provide a clear title and accurate description/context.  
4. Click **Create Pull Request** to submit your PR.  
5. Add GitHub labels to your PR. Always include the `documentation` label, and add others based on the type of update or request.

   - Quality  
   - Alignment with documentation scope  
3. Approving, requesting changes, or rejecting the PR.
