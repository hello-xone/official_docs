# Contribute to Xone

Thank you for your willingness to contribute to the Xone ecosystem! Whether it's fixing a typo, submitting a piece of code, improving asset metadata, or participating in specification development, every investment helps make Xone better. ‚ù§Ô∏è
<br/>
<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://bvi.xone.org/en/community">Xone community</Link> contributions now cover multiple code repositories (not just documentation):

- **WebSite**Ôºö<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/hello-xone/xone_website">hello-xone/xone_website</Link>  
- **Docs**Ôºö<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/hello-xone/official_docs">hello-xone/official_docs</Link>  
- **Assets**(Asset and apps metadata)Ôºö<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/hello-xone/xone_assets">hello-xone/xone_assets</Link>  

This guide will help you through the entire process, from raising an issue, creating a pull request (PR), code review, and merging and releasing your release. Unless otherwise noted, we recommend submitting pull requests/issues in English (multilingual documentation will be available in the future).

<Callout emoji="üèÅ">
  It‚Äôs great to start small: fixing a link, improving a description, adding an example or screenshot are all high-value contributions.
  Of course! If you‚Äôve contributed to any of the above repositories before, don‚Äôt forget to claim your POAP tokens!
</Callout>

## What can I contribute?

- **Website**: Optimize page copy and layout, component/style improvements, performance and SEO, accessibility, i18n text, routing and navigation optimization, etc.
- **Docs**: New chapters/tutorials, API/concept explanations, examples and best practices, fix broken links and formatting, illustrations and architecture diagrams, etc.
- **Assets**: Add/update token and DApp metadata (info.json, logo, etc.), cross-chain mapping, proofread official links, optimize tags and categories, and improve scripts and validation rules.
- **Other**: Propose standards (style guide, terminology, directory structure), create scripts and tools, reproduce issues and minimum requirements (MREs), provide roadmap feedback, etc.


## What You Should Know Before Contributing

1. Create a <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/signup">GitHub account</Link>.
2. Familiarize yourself with basic tools, technology stacks, and other important aspects:
  - Git & GitHub: Branch management, commits, and the pull request process.
  - Markdown: Document formatting and syntax.
  - Node.js & package managers (npm/yarn/pnpm): Dependency installation and script execution.
  - React & Next.js: Front-end component and page development (Website).
  - JSON/YAML: Configuration and data file editing (Assets).
  - ESLint/Prettier: Code style and formatting.
3. **Run the build locally first** before submitting a PR to avoid build failures.


## Local Development and Preview

Try to run the validation scripts provided by the repository locally (such as pnpm lint / pnpm validate , etc.; refer to the repository README for details).

<Callout emoji="üß™">
  Before submitting a pull request, be sure to:

  1. Stop other terminal processes and run `pnpm dev` to see if the build succeeds;

  2. Fix any errors or linking issues reported by the terminal;

  3. Run `pnpm fix` or the formatting/validation scripts provided by the repository;

  4. Run `pnpm dev` again until both the client and server compile successfully.

</Callout>

## How to submit a pull request

Fork the repository to your account and develop on a new branch:

Suggested branch names: `feat/‚Ä¶`, `fix/‚Ä¶`, `docs/‚Ä¶`, `chore/‚Ä¶`, etc.

Conventional Commits:

```

feat: New features/items (e.g., feat: add ABC token on Xone)

fix: Bug fixes

docs: Documentation and content

style: Style/formatting that doesn't affect the logic

refactor: Refactoring

perf: Performance optimization

test: Testing

build: Build-related

ci: CI configuration

chore: Miscellaneous

revert: Rollback

```

Submit a pull request to the upstream repository (usually the target branch is main; maintainers will notify you of any special branches during the review).

**In the PR description:**

1. Clearly explain the motivation and scope of the change;

2. Attach screenshots/screen recordings (for front-end changes);

3. Describe the verification steps and potential impact (mark "Breaking Change").

4. Add tags to the PR: Select at least one of "Documentation/Website/Assets"; other tags (bug, enhancement, good first issue, etc.) can be added as needed.

<br/>

If you're not ready for review yet, select "Create Draft Pull Request"; when ready, mark it "Ready for Review."

<Callout emoji="ü§ù">
  We assign and review PRs during business days:

  - Focus on **Accuracy**, **Quality**, and **Scope**;

  - May suggest changes;

  - After review, the PR will be merged and automatically deployed to the corresponding environment.
