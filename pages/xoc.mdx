# Xone Coin(XOC)

XOC is the native cryptocurrency of Xone Chain, operating similarly to ETH in the Ethereum ecosystem. Users need to use XOC tokens to interact with Xone Chain, as they are used to pay for gas fees associated with transactions and smart contract interactions. Additionally, XOC tokens play a crucial role in the network's security model, allowing users to lock their tokens through staking to help secure the network and earn corresponding rewards. They also play an important role in the Behavior Value Incentive (BVI) economic model.

## Token Economics

XOC is the core resource in the Xone Chain ecosystem, with a maximum token supply capped at 10 billion. This cap is designed to ensure the stability of the token's value and prevent inflation. These tokens provide power to the network, supporting staking and daily operations (such as initiating transactions and governance rewards), thereby ensuring the security and stability of the ecosystem.

In Xone Chain, XOC determines the weight of each node in network decision-making. According to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, validators will receive voting rights proportional to their staked XOC. To execute transactions on the network, users must pay gas fees, which will be burned, permanently removing them from circulation.

At the genesis, a total of 8 billion XOC tokens were minted. Subsequently, the system will gradually mint a small number of additional XOC tokens to reward validators for their active contributions, with corresponding rewards issued at the end of their staking period. This minting process will offset the funds consumed through transaction fees, with a total supply expected to reach 10 billion within approximately five years.

|  Organization Node Rewards  | 15%    | Released through GV rewards obtained via BVI incentive.   | 
|  Individual Node Rewards  | 10%    | Released through GV rewards obtained via BVI incentive.   | 
|  Early Contributors  | 10%    | Released once when the mainnet is launched.   | 
|  Investor Allocation  | 10%    | Released according to block height, released in 2 years.   | 
|  Team Allocation  | 10%    | The release will be completed in equal installments every quarter within 3 years.   | 
|  Staking Rewards  | 10%    | The output is regulated according to the weight coefficient of pledge mining.   | 
|  Community Allocation  | 7%    | Released through DAO voting and other activity plans.   | 
|  Airdrop Rewards  | 3%    | Released via airdrop (3%).   | 

In Xone Chain, validatorsâ€™ staked tokens will not be reduced due to negligence or malicious behavior. However, we do not encourage such behavior, as it not only wastes valuable computational resources but may also lead to validators missing out on rewards, potentially impacting the overall security and integrity of the network. By maintaining honesty and active participation, validators can not only safeguard their own interests but also contribute to the healthy development of the network.
