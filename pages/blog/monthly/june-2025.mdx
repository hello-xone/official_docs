**Dear!**

As the eastern sky first blushes with dawn’s gentle glow, the air around the floating bastion Xone feels charged with possibility.

The morning mist, having relinquished its hold, drifts away like dreams at sunrise.

Below, the chain-linked city stirs to life—lamps flicker, nodes awaken, and the hum of consensus grows ever steadier.

On deck, our Lead Validator stands at the rail, watching as a shard of sunlight catches the polished hull.

A subtle nod follows: the network has passed another rigorous performance verification under increased load. Smiles ripple through the team, for with every optimization comes renewed confidence in Xone’s evolution. 

And so begins our June story—a month where stability deepens, new horizons emerge, and every participant’s heartbeat pulses in time with Xone’s advancing rhythm…

## June TL;DR

This month, the Xone ecosystem has ushered in a number of important upgrades and iterations, injecting new vitality into the network stability, product experience and developer ecosystem.

- **Mainnet Hard Fork:** This month, we completed a critical <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/blog/bulletin/hard-fork">mainnet hard fork</Link> and officially launched the new <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/epoch">Epoch module</Link>. By introducing epoch-based cycle management, we can more precisely coordinate core network operations (such as reward distribution and validator rotation), laying a solid foundation for future feature expansions and economic model design.

- **Product Updates:** To ensure the Xone brand, we reconstructed the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://faucet.xone.org/en">faucet page UI</Link> and opened the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en/developer">developer platform</Link> during this period, enriching the information channel between developers and users. <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme">For BVI</Link>, a dedicated module was added to the official documentation, which detailed the principles and usage of BVI. More importantly, the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://nft.xone.org/en">Xone NFT market</Link> has officially migrated to the main network.

- **Contract Iterations:** Due to the update of Epoch, we upgraded the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/release">released contracts</Link> and completed the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/developers/contracts#mainnet-contracts-list">contract update of the cross-chain bridge</Link> to better execute cross-chain assets.

## 🛠 Mainnet Hard Fork

By introducing epoch-based cycle management, This module is based on <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/release">Evmos epochs</Link> and has more flexible time cycle management capabilities, we can more precisely coordinate core network operations (such as reward distribution and validator rotation), laying a solid foundation for future feature expansions and economic model design.

For users, you can view the current Epoch data <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xonescan.com/epochs">through the browser</Link>. If you are a developer, we believe that <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/gateway">gateway call</Link> here is more suitable for you.

## 🍾 The product is brand new

- **Faucet Page Redesign:** To give new users a more intuitive introduction to Xone’s brand identity, we completely overhauled the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://faucet.xone.org/en">faucet page</Link>. Both visuals and interactions now align with the official design system, helping users quickly obtain test assets.

- **Developer Platform Integration:** We incorporated the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en/developer">TokenUp developer platform</Link> into the ecosystem. Any DApp developer can now independently upload project information and view operational data on that platform. The uploaded information will be synchronized and displayed across the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://bvi.xone.org/en/ecology">Xone BVI ecosystem</Link> and the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en">TokenUp wallet</Link>, further enriching the information flow between developers and users.

![Developer](/blog/monthly/june_2025/developer.png)

- **BVI Introduction in Docs:** The official documentation now includes a dedicated chapter on <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme">BVI (Behavioral Value Incentive)</Link>, detailing its principles and usage. This helps developers and community members quickly understand and participate in the incentive system.

- **Xone NFT Marketplace Launched on Mainnet:** After validation on the testnet, the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://nft.xone.org/en">Xone NFT marketplace</Link> has officially migrated to the mainnet. All users can now safely mint, trade, and custody NFTs in the mainnet environment, ushering in a brand-new digital-collectible experience.

## 📃 Contract Iterations

- **Optimization of Donation and Team Token Release Contracts:** We upgraded the logic of the donation-release contract and the team-token-release contract so that all cycle calculations are now driven by the on-chain Epoch module. This means the release schedule will remain precisely synchronized with block height, further improving transparency and execution stability.

- **Cross-Chain Bridge Contract Update:** To better handle asset transfers in a multi-chain environment, we refactored and enhanced the security of the bridge contracts. The new version introduces more comprehensive verification logic for cross-chain validation and asset custody, significantly reducing potential risks and providing users with a more reliable cross-chain experience.
