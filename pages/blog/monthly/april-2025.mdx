**Dear!**

As night falls and time drifts into the early hours, the airborne fortress [Xone](https://xone.org/) gently sways above the mist.

With a soft click, the weather vane atop the mast shifts direction‚Äîsignaling the start of a new month. üåÉ

Below the hull, the chain-linked city sleeps soundly beneath a scatter of lights.

On deck, the on-duty Node Engineer notes the newly confirmed uptime, a slight smile forming on their lips: the fluctuations have finally stabilized.

And so, this month‚Äôs story begins with a quiet, yet deeply encouraging, test pass‚Ä¶

## April TL;DR

- **Core Optimizations:** With new participants joining the ecosystem, we‚Äôve <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/hello-xone/xone_chain">optimized the underlying architecture</Link>‚Äîresulting in improved TPS (transactions per second). Along the way, we also enhanced many unexpected areas.

- **Product Updates:** Guided by our <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="/study/roadmap">roadmap</Link>, we‚Äôve redesigned the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">official website</Link> to reflect a refreshed visual style. To support global expansion, we added multilingual support to both the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xone.org">website</Link> and <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://faucet.xone.org/en">faucet</Link>.
