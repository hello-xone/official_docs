**Dear!**

As the eastern sky first blushes with dawn‚Äôs gentle glow, the air around the floating bastion [Xone](https://xone.org/) feels charged with possibility.

The morning mist, having relinquished its hold, drifts away like dreams at sunrise.

Below, the chain-linked city stirs to life‚Äîlamps flicker, nodes awaken, and the hum of consensus grows ever steadier.

On deck, our Lead Validator stands at the rail, watching as a shard of sunlight catches the polished hull.

A subtle nod follows: the network has passed another rigorous performance verification under increased load. Smiles ripple through the team, for with every optimization comes renewed confidence in [Xone](https://xone.org/)‚Äôs evolution. 

And so begins our May story‚Äîa month where stability deepens, new horizons emerge, and every participant‚Äôs heartbeat pulses in time with [Xone](https://xone.org/)‚Äôs advancing rhythm‚Ä¶

## May TL;DR

This month, the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem has ushered in a number of important upgrades and iterations, injecting new vitality into the network stability, product experience and developer ecosystem.

- **Mainnet Hard Fork:** This month, we completed a critical <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/blog/bulletin/hard-fork">mainnet hard fork</Link> and officially launched the new <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/epoch">Epoch module</Link>. By introducing epoch-based cycle management, we can more precisely coordinate core network operations (such as reward distribution and validator rotation), laying a solid foundation for future feature expansions and economic model design.

- **Product Updates:** To ensure the [Xone](https://xone.org/) brand, we reconstructed the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://faucet.xone.org/en">faucet page UI</Link> and opened the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en/developer">developer platform</Link> during this period, enriching the information channel between developers and users. <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme">For BVI</Link>, a dedicated module was added to the official documentation, which detailed the principles and usage of BVI. More importantly, the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://nft.xone.org/en">Xone NFT market</Link> has officially migrated to the main network.

- **Contract Iterations:** Due to the update of Epoch, we upgraded the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/release">released contracts</Link> and completed the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/developers/contracts#mainnet-contracts-list">contract update of the cross-chain bridge</Link> to better execute cross-chain assets.

## üõ† Mainnet Hard Fork

By introducing epoch-based cycle management, This module is based on <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/study/release">Evmos epochs</Link> and has more flexible time cycle management capabilities, we can more precisely coordinate core network operations (such as reward distribution and validator rotation), laying a solid foundation for future feature expansions and economic model design.

For users, you can view the current Epoch data <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xonescan.com/epochs">through the browser</Link>. If you are a developer, we believe that <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/gateway">gateway call</Link> here is more suitable for you.

## üçæ The product is brand new

- **Faucet Page Redesign:** To give new users a more intuitive introduction to [Xone](https://xone.org/)‚Äôs brand identity, we completely overhauled the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://faucet.xone.org/en">faucet page</Link>. Both visuals and interactions now align with the official design system, helping users quickly obtain test assets.

- **Developer Platform Integration:** We incorporated the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en/developer">TokenUp developer platform</Link> into the ecosystem. Any DApp developer can now independently upload project information and view operational data on that platform. The uploaded information will be synchronized and displayed across the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://bvi.xone.org/en/ecology">Xone BVI ecosystem</Link> and the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://tokenup.org/en">TokenUp wallet</Link>, further enriching the information flow between developers and users.

![Developer](/blog/monthly/may_2025/developer.png)

- **BVI Introduction in Docs:** The official documentation now includes a dedicated chapter on <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme">BVI (Behavioral Value Incentive)</Link>, detailing its principles and usage. This helps developers and community members quickly understand and participate in the incentive system.

![Introduction](/blog/monthly/may_2025/introduction.png)

- **[Xone](https://xone.org/) NFT Marketplace Launched on Mainnet:** After validation on the testnet, the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://nft.xone.org/en">Xone NFT marketplace</Link> has officially migrated to the mainnet. All users can now safely mint, trade, and custody NFTs in the mainnet environment, ushering in a brand-new digital-collectible experience.

## üìÉ Contract Iterations

- **Optimization of Donation and Team Token Release Contracts:** We upgraded the logic of the donation-release contract and the team-token-release contract so that all cycle calculations are now driven by the on-chain Epoch module. This means the release schedule will remain precisely synchronized with block height, further improving transparency and execution stability.

- **Cross-Chain Bridge Contract Update:** To better handle asset transfers in a multi-chain environment, we refactored and enhanced the security of the bridge contracts. The new version introduces more comprehensive verification logic for cross-chain validation and asset custody, significantly reducing potential risks and providing users with a more reliable cross-chain experience.
