**Dear!**

July didn’t so much dawn as it switched on.

Screens blinked awake; Spaces went live; someone on the deck yelled “mic check” into the wind. A summer of AMAs rolled across time zones while the crew penciled in one more IRL stop—this time, a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, warm air and bright city lights.

Six live sessions, one pool party, a stack of new metrics. We wrapped the month with momentum still humming (and a few hoarse voices).

Thus begins the story of July: conversations, touchpoints, and a community that keeps showing up—sometimes earlier than the host, which is honestly kind of lovely.

## July TL;DR

[Xone](https://xone.org/) spent July talking with the world, not just to it—six AMAs across Meme Coins, DeFi, AI Agents, the BVI model, and a Web3 OS vision; a KL rooftop event with partners; plus fresh community signals from the FEIXIAOHAO.AI special.

## 🎙 July AMA Series — Highlights & Takeaways

We wrapped six AMAs in July—meme behavior to system UX, quick hits below.

- **Jul 17 · TreeFinance** — The Rise of Meme Coins & the Era of Behavioral Financialization Behavior isn’t noise. It’s signal—sticky loops, measurable value, retention you can actually graph.

- **Jul 19 · TreeFinance** — DeFi’s Structural Contradictions & BVI’s Value Reset From gas/PoW barriers to the Matthew Effect; the case for rewarding contribution, not just capital.

- **Jul 22 · TreeFinance** — AI Agent Economics Yield routes, market-making, and risk rails (DID, multisig, audits). Agents are fast; safeguards must be faster.

- **Jul 24 · FEIXIAOHAO.AI** — How Behavior Incentives Reshape L1sData call-outs: testnet **3M+** wallets, block height **17,192,116**, latency **~1.4 ms**. Session traction cleared **100k** views—pretty wild.

- **Jul 28 · TreeFinance** — Beyond PoW/PoS: The BVI Model A consensus reframe: participation > stake; contribution > compute. Not heresy, just overdue.

- **Jul 30 · [Xone](https://xone.org/) Official Space** — Web3 OS & Multi-Chain UX One interface for assets, auth, and dApp flows—without throwing decentralization overboard.

## 🏙 KL Rooftop Pool Party — XONE × Anome

July 21. Kuala Lumpur skyline. <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://x.com/xone_chain/status/1946133765513753086">We teamed up with Anome for a community night</Link>: Web3 OS + BVI demos, a KOL roundtable on financialized play, and an on-site airdrop segment.

IRL still hits different. SEA keeps proving it.

**Community perk:** a limited airdrop (100 winners, **10,000 XOC total**). Good vibes + good incentives.

## 💧 Liquidity & Market Access

The USDT/XOC pool on SwapX stayed the stablecoin route of choice; July 8 got flagged publicly as a milestone for the pair.

LPs and devs can track fees/depth right on SwapX. <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://swapx.exchange/zh/pool/v2?id=0x865ec1f3c313e2f050933fb264950fac535839f8">USDT/XOC Pool</Link>

Discussions ranged from throughput vs. UX to how incentives shape long-term contributor behavior. Some spicy takes, all productive.

## 🔭 What’s Next

- **Spaces & AMAs:** High cadence into August—more co-hosts, more time zones. We’ll keep the mix bilingual.

- **Wallet:** TokenUp v2.4.0 security upgrade rolled out **Aug 1**—small note, big peace of mind.

- **Website Revamp:** A cleaner visual system, tighter typography, faster loads. Rolling out in phases with dark mode and a refreshed component library.

- **Block Explorer Upgrade:** Richer tx/contract views, validator profiles, improved charts, and steadier APIs. Search feels snappier; data refresh is faster.

- **Official Staking (testing):** In closed beta now—delegation, unbonding, rewards curves, and safety checks under active review before wider release.

- **Grants Program:** Milestone-based grants for infrastructure, tooling, and apps. Details and application windows coming soon.

- **hello.xone (DID) transfers:** Human-readable transfers are around the corner—name→wallet resolution, profile linking, and multi-dApp compatibility.

Dates may shift slightly as we polish the edges—that’s the rhythm: **Ship**, **Listen**, **Refine**.
