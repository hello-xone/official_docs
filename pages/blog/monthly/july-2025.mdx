**Dear!**

July didn‚Äôt so much dawn as it switched on.

Screens blinked awake; Spaces went live; someone on the deck yelled ‚Äúmic check‚Äù into the wind. A summer of AMAs rolled across time zones while the crew penciled in one more IRL stop‚Äîthis time, a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, warm air and bright city lights.

Six live sessions, one pool party, a stack of new metrics. We wrapped the month with momentum still humming (and a few hoarse voices).

Thus begins the story of July: conversations, touchpoints, and a community that keeps showing up‚Äîsometimes earlier than the host, which is honestly kind of lovely.

## July TL;DR

[Xone](https://xone.org/) spent July talking with the world, not just to it‚Äîsix AMAs across Meme Coins, DeFi, AI Agents, the BVI model, and a Web3 OS vision; a KL rooftop event with partners; plus fresh community signals from the FEIXIAOHAO.AI special.

## üéô July AMA Series ‚Äî Highlights & Takeaways

We wrapped six AMAs in July‚Äîmeme behavior to system UX, quick hits below.

- **Jul 17 ¬∑ TreeFinance** ‚Äî The Rise of Meme Coins & the Era of Behavioral Financialization Behavior isn‚Äôt noise. It‚Äôs signal‚Äîsticky loops, measurable value, retention you can actually graph.

July 21. Kuala Lumpur skyline. <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://x.com/xone_chain/status/1946133765513753086">We teamed up with Anome for a community night</Link>: Web3 OS + BVI demos, a KOL roundtable on financialized play, and an on-site airdrop segment.

IRL still hits different. SEA keeps proving it.

**Community perk:** a limited airdrop (100 winners, **10,000 XOC total**). Good vibes + good incentives.

## üíß Liquidity & Market Access

The USDT/XOC pool on SwapX stayed the stablecoin route of choice; July 8 got flagged publicly as a milestone for the pair.
