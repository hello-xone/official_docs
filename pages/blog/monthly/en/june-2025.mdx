**Dear!**

As the first light of dawn stretches across the sky, a new energy pulses through the floating fortress of Xone.

The morning mist fades, like the night gently withdrawing before daybreak.

Below the city, the network comes alive—nodes awaken, beacons light up, and consensus begins to resonate.

On deck, the Lead Validator gazes ahead, a sliver of sunlight reflecting off the ship’s hull.

With a slight nod: the **USDT/XOC v2 liquidity pool** is now live on SwapX and running smoothly. Cheers ripple among the team—each iteration a step forward for the ecosystem.

Thus begins the story of June: a month of mechanisms deployed, partnerships expanded, and community rewards in full swing.
