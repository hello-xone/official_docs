Dear node operators and developer community:

[Xone](https://xone.org/) will perform a hard fork upgrade at the designated block height of the main network to formally introduce the new Epochs module. This module is based on <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/epochs">Evmos epochs</Link> and has more flexible time cycle management capabilities, laying the foundation for future incentives, governance and scheduled task mechanisms.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  This upgrade involves changes to the state machine and storage structure, requiring all nodes to complete restart and binary replacement before the previous block at the specified block height.
</Callout>

## ‚õì Upgrade Overview

**Upgrade Method:** Hard Fork

**New Modules:** <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/study/epoch">Epochs</Link> (introducing modules StoreKey, lifecycle hooks, Genesis logic)

**Target Block Height:** `# 6397023`

**Execution Time:** 2025-05-28 11:00:00 (UTC+0)

**Operation Requirements:** All mainnet nodes must complete the new version deployment and restart before **Height `# 6397022`**

## üîç Technical Change Notes

**1. StoreKey Registration and IAVL State Consistency**

  - Each module needs to register its storage prefix (StoreKey) through `store.NewKVStoreKey` at startup.

  - Dynamically adding StoreKey will destroy the structure and hash certainty of the IAVL state tree, resulting in consensus forks.

  - Therefore, the node must be restarted before height `# 6397022` to ensure that the new binary correctly loads the module's storage structure.

**2. Lifecycle Hooks (BeginBlocker / EndBlocker)**

  - The Epochs module triggers corresponding logic processing in each block and needs to be registered in `SetOrderBeginBlockers()`.

  - Nodes that have not been restarted will miss the hook call, resulting in state differences and unable to participate in consensus.

**3. InitGenesis Execution and Module Initialization**

  - New modules need to register the initial state logic through `SetOrderInitGenesis()`.

  - When upgrading, the `InitGenesis` initialization state will be executed before the block `#6397023` is started. Non-upgraded nodes will crash due to missing data.

## üß© Upgrade mechanism implementation

We use the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk">Cosmos SDK</Link> standard `UpgradeStoreLoader` and version control logic to implement secure on-chain module introduction:

``` go showLineNumbers copy filename="app.go"
app.SetStoreLoader(upgradetypes.UpgradeStoreLoader(
  ForkAddEpochsMainNetHeight,
  &storetypes.StoreUpgrades{
    Added: []string{epochsmoduletypes.StoreKey},
  },
))
```

- Fork height is dynamically injected after being determined by chain ID;

- StoreKey registration and module status initialization are completed when the upgrade block is initialized;

- Avoid writing in inconsistent states.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Node Operation Guide

1. Confirm the upgrade height `# 6397023`;

2. Complete the node binary replacement and restart before the height `# 6397022`;

3. Use the new <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="/developers/operators/start/quick-start">version of the Xone node program</Link> containing the Epochs module;

4. After restarting, the system will automatically initialize the state tree and operation logic of the new module.

## üß† Why can't modules be added dynamically?

- The Cosmos SDK state machine requires that all node state changes are completely consistent;

- StoreKey is directly associated with the state hash, and dynamic addition will destroy the hash consistency;

- The lack of `BeginBlocker`, `EndBlocker` and `InitGenesis` logic will cause unpredictable operating behavior;

Therefore, **restarting the binary and loading the module before upgrading is the best way to upgrade safely**.
