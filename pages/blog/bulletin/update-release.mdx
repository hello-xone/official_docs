Dear [Xone](https://xone.org/) community members:

In order to further improve the openness, transparency and verifiability of the token release mechanism, the [Xone](https://xone.org/) mainnet has recently completed the Epoch module upgrade, and the relevant token release logic has been optimized and adjusted as follows:

## 🔄 Technical mechanism update: access to the chain-level Epoch module

Since <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/blog/bulletin/hard-fork">hard fork height `6397023`</Link>, the bottom layer of [Xone](https://xone.org/) has officially enabled the standardized <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/study/epoch">Epochs</Link> module. The original [Xone](https://xone.org/) donation and team token release logic cycle came from the custom Epoch cycle judgment (that is, it was realized by contract calculation according to the fast release height), and now it has been fully switched to the use of the chain-level unified Epoch scheduling system for processing (**The release here is defined according to Day**).

This will achieve:

- ⏱ **Unified cycle logic**: All release rhythms are based on the <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/study/epoch#core-functions-of-epoch">Epoch module on the chain (every 86400 S = 1 day)</Link> for precise calculation;

- 📊 **Verifiable process**: Release data can be tracked and verified in real time in the <Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xonescan.com/address/0x08b48c7e6175f1E3BDa4300dC6ee4FbC00ebfC6d">block browser</Link>;

- 🛠 **Modular management**: Combined with the upgraded Hook architecture, release events are synchronized with the network.

## 📅 ​​Change Overview

1. The release cycle of the donation token will be changed from the original plan of early August to 2025/6/26 00:00:00 (UTC+0), with a release interval of 3 natural days, and a total of 2 years for the release, with a total of 203 release points.

2. The original team release contract is abandoned (<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xonescan.com/address/0x1b553A9B5C47F55F1777f024CaB3038ddbF89c0e">0x1b553A9B5C47F55F1777f024CaB3038ddbF89c0e</Link>), and the donation release contract is updated to the new version (<Link className='text-primaryHue' isExternal showAnchorIcon href="https://xonescan.com/address/0x08b48c7e6175f1E3BDa4300dC6ee4FbC00ebfC6d">0x08b48c7e6175f1E3BDa4300dC6ee4FbC00ebfC6d</Link>).

[Xone](https://xone.org/) always adheres to long-term development, respects user trust, and pursues a safer and more open economic operation mechanism. This adjustment not only improves the auditability of the release mechanism, but also lays a solid foundation for the sustainable growth of the entire ecosystem.

Thank you to all community members and validators for their continued attention and support!
