Dear node operators and developer community:
<br/>
Xone Network (BVI) serves as the global operations and brand entity of the Xone ecosystem. Authorized local independent entities operate in each country/region in accordance with applicable local laws, while major decisions are governed through DAO processes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Important Note:**
  Xone’s public blockchain is open infrastructure that allows any global team, developer, or community to freely deploy contracts and build applications permissionlessly—a core principle of Web3 decentralization: technology-neutral, transparent, and accessible to all. Xone does not endorse, guarantee, or officially partner with any on-chain project. These projects are independently developed, operated, and solely responsible for their own risks and outcomes. Users are strongly advised to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before participating in any project, especially those involving financial transactions.
