# Active organization —— unleash the power of your collective wisdom in the Xone ecosystem

The power of collaboration can change the world. An excellent organization is not just a machine that completes tasks, but also a core node of the trust network and the most influential promoter in the ecosystem. Every organization, regardless of size or background, deserves to be seen, trusted, and empowered as long as it is willing to actively participate and share value.

Whether you are a DAO, a startup team, a non-profit organization, or a research community, as long as you are willing to build value in the Xone world, there is a place for you here.

## What is an active organization identity?

Active organization identity is an **on-chain organizational image carrier** established by the Xone ecosystem for teams, organizations and collectives. It is an open and verifiable "organization business card" that helps you showcase your vision, actions, governance methods and influence.

Whether it is a DAO, community, guild, research group or operation team, you can use the organizational identity to:

- Bind core members, clarify the collaboration structure and representatives;

- Publicize organizational responsibilities, achievements and cooperation records;

- Allocate ecological incentives and promote internal incentive mechanisms;

- Establish trusted connections with other organizations or projects to expand the cooperation network;

- Participate in platform governance, obtain decision-making power, resource tilt and on-chain feedback.

## Why do organizations need such an identity?

  A vibrant organization should not just be a behind-the-scenes hero, it deserves to be seen, trusted, and connected.

**Strengthen collaboration**: Governance and resource allocation under a unified identity system to reduce confusion and improve collaboration efficiency;

**Accumulate reputation**: All organizational contributions will be on-chain to build real and traceable reputation assets;

**Link ecosystem**: As a trusted node, establish sustainable cooperative relationships with projects and users;

**Participate in governance**: Vote and propose as an organization, so that voices have weight and promote institutional evolution.

## What are the characteristics of active organization identity?

We hope to build a "sustainable, trustworthy, and collaborative" organizational identity system so that all teams, DAOs, and communities willing to participate in Xone as an organization have a clear and free digital representative. It has the following characteristics:

**Combinable**: An organization can be composed of multiple members and assign authority and responsibilities;

**Governable**: It has a clear governance mechanism and can participate in major ecological decisions;

**Settlable**: It connects with the platform's incentive mechanism to facilitate the distribution of contribution rewards;

**Collaborative**: Cooperation between organizations and between projects/individuals is easier to identify and carry out.

## What does it mean to have an identity?

It means that you are no longer an address or logo, and you are not troubled by "who is operating behind the scenes", but an effective carrier that is verified and continuously contributing. You can:

- Show organizational culture and values;
- Undertake more cooperation and resource flow, and obtain more resource allocation opportunities and exposure;
- Enhance influence, initiate community activities, governance proposals, and participate in ecological governance;
- Empower organizational members, enhance cohesion; obtain organizational rewards and member rewards.

## We welcome such organizations

- Startup teams that have been established not long ago but have great ambitions;
- DAOs that are willing to deepen, enthusiastically promote and participate in Xone governance and co-construction;
- Supportive organizations that provide services, resources or construction capabilities to promote industry exchanges;
- Incubators or community guilds dedicated to promoting project growth;
- Organizations with technical depth or research results in a certain field;
- Groups that promote public welfare, education, popular science, and other public values ​​that build knowledge, content or infrastructure for a long time.

No matter your size or background, as long as you are willing to keep building and actively participate, we have a place for you.
