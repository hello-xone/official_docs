# Independent Projects —— Let your creativity shine in the Xone ecosystem

We firmly believe! Every idea is worth seeing, and every attempt is worth recording. Whether you are a startup team, an independent developer, or a project owner with mature products, as long as you are willing to build value in the decentralized world, there is a place for you here.

At Xone, we encourage projects to grow openly and transparently, and gain ecological trust and resource support. Project identity is not only your business card on the chain, but also the starting point for you to connect with users, organizations and resources.

## What is project identity?

Project identity is a **trusted digital identity** created by Xone Ecosystem for project parties, allowing you to display your vision, record progress, obtain incentives, participate in governance, and deeply collaborate with other roles in the ecosystem on an open platform.

Through project identity, you can:

- Publicize basic project information and build a credible image; including basic information such as project name, logo, and introduction;

- All important activities, technical achievements, cooperation cases, and incentive data will be recorded on the chain, so that everyone can see the real growth trajectory of the project;

- Your project can not only gain the trust of more users and partners through identity display, but also participate in platform governance and jointly promote ecological development;

- Participate in platform governance and obtain decision-making power and resource tilt;

## Why is project identity so important?

<Callout>
  A trustworthy project should not be buried in information noise; it needs a public stage that is authentic, traceable and sustainable.
</Callout>

We are well aware that in this era of information explosion, every project hopes to gain more attention and recognition. The design of the project identity system is to help you:

**Establish credibility:** Through identity authentication and information on the chain, the project obtains authentic and credible ecological endorsement;

**Get support**: Publicly appear in the ecosystem to attract the participation and collaboration of developers, organizers and users;

**Incentives and feedback**: By recording the project's contribution data and incentive points (GV) in the ecosystem, you can obtain more incentive resources and promote the sustainable development of the project.

**Cross-platform interconnection**: Project identity supports universal use among multiple decentralized applications and organizations. You can seamlessly connect with different platforms without repeated authentication to form a greater ecological effect.

**Participate in governance**: Participate in platform proposals and voting on behalf of the project, voice the industry, and influence the evolution of the ecosystem.

## Its features

We hope to create a project identity system that is "transparent and traceable, open and co-built, and continuously growing", so that every project that truly devotes itself to the construction of Web3 can be recorded, understood, and supported. It has the following features:

**Verifiable**: Public project information and on-chain behavior to ensure transparency and credibility;

**Traceable**: Every step of the project's growth can be recorded and presented;

**Collaborative**: Projects under identity binding are convenient for other organizations or individuals to find cooperation;

**Incentivizable**: The ecosystem will distribute incentive points, resource positions, and more equity support to high-quality projects.

## What can it bring to you?

This means that your project is no longer just a contract address in Xone, but a **participant with vision, contribution, and governance rights**. You can:

- Gather community support and build external trust;
- Attract talents, organizations, and resources;
- Get platform incentives and recommendations;
- Participate in platform governance and proposals to influence the direction of the ecosystem.

## We welcome such projects

- Creative projects that are being launched or explored;
- Teams that promote Web3 tools/services with an open source spirit;
- Innovative projects dedicated to building on-chain social, financial, content, gaming and other scenarios;
- Teams that need a trust foundation and want to establish connections with the user community;
- Project parties that hope to participate in ecological governance and grow with the platform.

As long as you are willing to start, Xone will be your trusted soil.
