# Free individual —— let your every participation be seen

We believe that every participant deserves to be respected, recorded, and recognized. You don't need to be a well-known developer, nor do you have to own a company - as long as you are willing to participate, contribute, and communicate, you are an indispensable part of the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem.

Whether you are a creator, developer, designer, community contributor, or just an explorer who is curious about the decentralized world, there is an identity space for you here.

## What is a free personal identity?

A free personal identity is a decentralized digital identity that represents your existence and value in the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem. It records every action you take in the ecosystem, whether it is participating in governance, supporting projects, or creating content and interacting with the community. This identity will become your most authentic digital imprint.

You can use a free personal identity to:

- Show your areas of interest and skill tags, and build your own credible profile;

- Record the projects, activities, contributions and incentives you participate in, and move freely between different projects and platforms;

- Prove your activity and influence in the ecosystem, and obtain incentives and ecosystem support based on contributions;

- Participate in platform governance and influence the future direction with voting and voice.

## Why do you want a free personal identity?

<Callout>
  Everyone has the ability to create value, and every tiny action is worth recording and rewarding.

**Being seen**: Every time you vote, submit, participate or express, it is no longer a silent contribution, it will be recorded on the chain and truly displayed.

**Being recognized**: The [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem will give incentive points (GV) based on your contribution and open up more permissions and resources for you.

**Being connected**: You can establish direct connections with projects, organizations or other individuals, which will become the basis for future collaboration.

**Being empowered**: You have the right to participate in platform governance and jointly determine the rules, rather than just being a passive user.

## Characteristics of free personal identity

We hope to create an "open, free, real and credible" personal identity system with the following characteristics:

**Verifiable**: All contributions and behaviors are supported by data and can be verified;

**Accumulative**: Your identity evolves over time and records your growth curve;

**Cross-platform**: Not only BVI, you can carry this identity on more decentralized platforms in the future;

**You have the final say**: You have control over all identity data and can choose to display, hide or migrate.

## What does it mean to have an identity?

It means that you are no longer just an anonymous address, but an individual with traces, influence and choice. You can:

- Build a reputation through participation;
- Be seen by projects and organizations and become an important part of the collaborative network;
- Obtain "digital reputation" recognized by the ecosystem, opening up more opportunities for you;
- Be able to influence the direction of the ecosystem of "us" in the name of "me"
