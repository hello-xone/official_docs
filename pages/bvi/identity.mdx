# Let the value be seen and make participation more meaningful

Welcome to the home of the BVI identity system! Here, we firmly believe that every participant deserves a unique and warm digital identity. Whether you are a shining individual, a united and collaborative organization, or a project that dares to innovate, your identity is the valuable footprint you leave in this ecosystem.

Our identity system is not just a simple blockchain address, but a comprehensive digital business card that records your historical contributions, personal reputation and participation. Combined with decentralized identity (DID) technology, we ensure that each identity is secure, transparent and fully controlled by you, so that every interaction and effort can be truly recorded and shared.

## Why choose our identity system?

In a decentralized world, we reject centralized identity management, but we need a **real and credible way to identify each other's value**. Identity is not just a label, but also the basis for connecting trust, collaboration and motivation.

[Xone](https://xone.org/) BVI identity system was born for this purpose.

We believe:

- A project deserves to show its creativity and development;

- An organization should reflect its collaboration and contribution;

- An individual should have his own records and voice.

Therefore, we have built three core identity types to cover every role in the ecosystem.

## Their characteristics

**Free definition:** Each user can freely set their own nickname, avatar and profile to show themselves in the most authentic way. Your identity is an extension of your unique personality.

**Cross-domain interoperability:** The identity system we built supports seamless connection between different DApps and DAOs. No matter where you participate, you can use the same identity to freely connect to the entire ecosystem.

**Openness and inclusiveness:** Whether you are an individual, a team or a project, we welcome you to join. Here, you can not only show yourself, but also grow together with like-minded partners and work together to build a more open and transparent digital world.

## Explore our identity

We hope that through this identity system, every participant can feel warmth and trust. Identity is not only a label, but also a record of your digital journey. No matter where you come from or what role you play, we look forward to working with you to promote this possible and beautiful future.

## The relationship between them

![relationship](public/images/relationship.png)

As for the connection between identities, as shown in the figure above; they will have their own independent joining and invitation relationships, and all identities are based on BVI's unified governance, identity confirmation and legal authorization, providing identity authentication support for the entire network.

Regarding identity rights and the connection between them, reasonable adjustments will be made based on the governance proposal; for today's [Xone](https://xone.org/), BVI's identity system will be processed **according to the single-line two-way logic of individuals joining organizations and organizations joining projects**. Individuals cannot join projects without organizations, and of course, projects themselves cannot invite individuals to join;

However, in this process, **individuals will have 2.00% rebates after joining the organization** given to the organization that joins; this purpose is for [Xone](https://xone.org/) to tilt more resources to organizations that join BVI in the startup phase; of course, as the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecological project grows, more high-quality rights and interests will be obtained for individuals and project identities.
