# Season Overview

Here, each season is not only a wonderful themed adventure, but also an incentive experiment around behavioral value. You will accumulate behavioral value points (GV) by completing tasks, participating in interactions and collaborations, winning rewards, building identity, and participating in governance.

Whether you are a free explorer, an organization builder, or an ecological governance promoter, you can find your own season journey here.

## 🔑 Core highlights of the season

**BVI drive**: Each season relies on the BVI (Behavior Value Incentive) system to ensure that user behavior is real and quantifiable, and contribution is value.

**Periodic update**: A new season is launched from time to time, and the theme, gameplay and reward mechanism are completely renewed.

**Multiple incentives**: Behavior points (GV), governance rights (GVOTING) and future identity systems (NFT/DID) advance in multiple dimensions.

**Multi-dimensional tracks**: Support various forms of participation by individuals, teams and projects to promote multi-level ecological construction.

## 📘 What is a season?

Season is the most dynamic periodic behavior incentive mechanism in the [Xone](https://xone.org/) ecosystem. It builds a task-based, traceable, and governable full-chain experience process based on the concepts of **behavioral value empowerment** and **identity autonomy**.

## **🎮 Gameplay Features**

**Thematic Narrative**: Each season is designed around a narrative world for tasks and challenges (such as "Interstellar Expedition" → "Ecological Revival").

**Dynamic Regulation**: Task difficulty and reward distribution are dynamically adjusted with community behavior data.

**Governance Linkage**: Season results will affect the weight and representative distribution of subsequent governance issues.

## 🎯 How to participate?

1. **Select identity:** Any on-chain address, DAO user, or project party can register to participate.

2. **Participate in interaction:** By completing season-specific behaviors or organization/project-defined behaviors.

3. **Waiting for settlement:** After completing the task, [Xone](https://xone.org/) will settle GV by counting the actual behavior completion.

4. **Exchange value:** The GV accumulated through behavioral tasks is exchanged for tangible value assets.
