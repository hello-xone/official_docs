## Chain info

Supplies details about the [Xone](https://xone.org/) network, its protocol version, and its configuration.

[eth_chainId](/openapi/chaininfo/eth_chainId) : Returns the chain ID of the network. \
[eth_protocolVersion](/openapi/chaininfo/eth_protocolVersion) : Provides the protocol version in use by the client. \
[net_listening](/openapi/chaininfo/net_listening) : Checks if the client is actively listening for network connections. \
[net_version](/openapi/chaininfo/net_version) : Retrieves the current network version. \
[net_peerCount](/openapi/chaininfo/net_peerCount) : Returns the number of active peers connected to the node. \
[eth_syncing](/openapi/chaininfo/eth_syncing) : Indicates if the node is currently synchronizing with the network. \
[eth_hashrate](/openapi/chaininfo/eth_hashrate) : Provides the node's current mining hashrate.

These methods offer insights into the network's health, configuration, and performance on Xone.
