## Executing transactions

Facilitates sending ETH, executing smart contracts, and performing on-chain operations.

[eth_call](/openapi/executingtransactions/eth_call) : Executes a read-only call to a smart contract without making state changes. \
[eth_sendRawTransaction](/openapi/executingtransactions/eth_sendRawTransaction) : Sends a raw, signed transaction to the Xone blockchain for execution.

These methods are critical for interacting with smart contracts and sending transactions on the Xone network.
